# Recommender-Systems
Collaborative Filtering - Global Base Line - User to User - Item to Item - Singular Value Decomposition

Data : https://www.kaggle.com/c/da517-2021-the4

Task:

-Minimizing RSME 

-Itâ€™s forbidden to use any library available on the web for the recommender systems

-Approach1: User to user collaborative filtering method. 

-Approach2: Item to item collaborative filtering method.  

-Approach3: Collaborative filtering combined with global baseline approach.  

-Approach4: LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) method. I will be extracting latent meanings of users/movies by using SVD to make some predictions.
